# Quick Start

Clone the repository with the following command:

    git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-datafu.git
    cd incubator-datafu

## Build

To build the JARs, run:

    ./gradlew assemble

This will produce snapshot JARs for the next upcoming release, `<%= current_page.data.next_version %>`.  There is not _yet_ an official Apache release for DataFu, so for the moment we recommend building the latest version from HEAD.

### DataFu Pig

After building, the DataFu Pig artifacts can be found in `datafu-pig/build/libs`.  This should contain:

* `datafu-pig-incubating-<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>.jar`
* `datafu-pig-incubating-<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>-javadoc.jar`
* `datafu-pig-incubating-<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>-sources.jar`

The `datafu-pig-incubating-<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>.jar` file can now be used in Pig!

See [DataFu Pig - Getting Started](/docs/datafu/getting-started.html) for next steps.

### DataFu Hourglass

After building, the DataFu Hourglass artifacts can be found in `datafu-hourglass/build/libs`.  This should contain:

* `datafu-hourglass-incubating-<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>.jar`
* `datafu-hourglass-incubating-<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>-javadoc.jar`
* `datafu-hourglass-incubating-<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>-sources.jar`

DataFu Hourglass has several external library dependencies that are required in order to use it.  Therefore, the easiest way to get started using it is to install DataFu to your local maven repository:

    ./gradlew install

Assuming your local maven repository is at `~/.m2`, you should see the DataFu Hourglass libraries under `~/.m2/repository/org/apache/datafu/datafu-hourglass-incubating/<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>`.

You should now be able to declare a dependency on DataFu Hourglass.

Gradle:

```groovy
compile "org.apache.datafu:datafu-hourglass-incubating:<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>"
```

Ivy:

```xml
<dependency org="org.apache.datafu" name="datafu-hourglass-incubating" rev="<%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %>"/>
```

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.datafu</groupId>
  <artifactId>datafu-hourglass-incubating</artifactId>
  <version><%= current_page.data.snapshot_version %></version>
</dependency>
```
