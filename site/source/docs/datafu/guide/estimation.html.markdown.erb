## Estimation

In some cases you don't need exact results.  Estimates may be sufficient if it results in more efficient
execution.  With this in mind Apache DataFu has UDFs for computing estimates of certain quantities.

### Median and Quantiles

[StreamingMedian](/docs/datafu/<%= current_page.data.version %>/datafu/pig/stats/StreamingMedian.html) and
[StreamingQuantile](/docs/datafu/<%= current_page.data.version %>/datafu/pig/stats/StreamingQuantile.html) can
compute estimates of the [median](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)
and [quantiles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile) of bags. The advantage of these methods is they do not require
the input bags to be sorted.  

See [Statistics](/docs/datafu/guide/statistics.html) for more details.

### Cardinality

The [cardinality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality) of a data set is the number of distinct elements
within it.  

Suppose we have data consisting of member IDs and we want to know the count of distinct member IDs.
We can do this in Pig as follows:

```pig
data = FOREACH data GENERATE member_id;
data = DISTINCT data;
data = FOREACH (GROUP data ALL) GENERATE SIZE(data);
```

However, this requires two jobs.  Alternatively we can use the
[HyperLogLogPlusPlus](/docs/datafu/<%= current_page.data.version %>/datafu/pig/stats/HyperLogLogPlusPlus.html) UDF
to estimate the cardinality with good accuracy using only one job:

```pig
define HyperLogLogPlusPlus datafu.pig.stats.HyperLogLogPlusPlus();
data = FOREACH (GROUP data ALL) GENERATE HyperLogLogPlusPlus(data);
```

The `HyperLogLogPlusPlus` UDF uses an implementation of the
[HyperLogLog++](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/40671.pdf)
algorithm provided by the [stream-lib](https://github.com/addthis/stream-lib) library.  HyperLogLog++ itself is an enhancement to
the well known [HyperLogLog](http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf) algorithm.
